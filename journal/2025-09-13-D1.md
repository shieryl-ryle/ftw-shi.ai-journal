# Journal — 2025-09-13 — Day 1: Setup the environment & Learn the fundamentals of DE

## 1) What I learned 
- I learned how to use DBeaver
- I learned the DE workflow
- I learned about pipelining
- I LEARNED HOW TO USE THIS NEW TOOL: METABASE!! it was so cool because it has already a built in GUI (web based) & i dont have to install it.

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **Dbvear** - relatives of justin bieber, jk. its a db management tools and its OPEN SOURCE
- **dlt** - in my own understanding, dlt is like playing a **game** where everyone writes down our scores on our own notebooks. every time my friends scored, **everyone writes it down at the same time** it is like stacking those scores into blocks so no one can erase or change them.
- **OLTP** - day-to-day, fast transactions
- **OLAP** - big-picture, patterns, reports
- **Sandbox DB** - My own **playground** where I can use to test queries, models or even pipelines.
  
## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Raw stays raw → Clean → Mart (separate layers).
- Document assumptions & decisions (why, not just what).

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- During class, I assumed the host was `Clickhouse` instead of using the localhost IP and it worked xD

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- How do data engineers decide between SQL and NoSQL?

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] Study Git basics and practice making commits.
- [ ] Learn about different types of databases (relational vs. NoSQL).

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
What surprised me? What would I do differently next time? What will I watch out for in production?
**I was surprised at how much small details can shape my understanding. Even simple concepts can open the door to deeper questions. I want to train myself to slow down and pay attention, instead of rushing to the next thing. That way, I’ll build stronger foundations as I move forward**

### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
**Caption:** my face while fixing my Docker to native while sir Myk is getting stressed
