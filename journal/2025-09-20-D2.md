## 1) What I learned  
- About **primary keys (PKs)** and **foreign keys (FKs)** and their roles in keeping relationships in a database  
- The importance of **DB normalization** (1NF → 3NF / BCNF)  
- Fundamentals of **data modeling**:  
  - **Facts** = measures (verbs)  
  - **Dimensions** = attributes (nouns)  

---

## 2) New Vocabulary  
| Term | My Own Words |
|------|--------------|
| **DB Normalization** | Organizing data into structured tables so redundancy and errors are minimized |
| **1NF** | Every column holds atomic values; no multiple items in one cell |
| **2NF** | Every non-key field depends on the *entire* composite key |
| **3NF** | Attributes must depend only on the primary key, not on other non-key fields |
| **DBT Test** | Validations to ensure the data makes sense (e.g., no duplicate IDs) |

## 3) Data Engineering Mindset Applied  
> “Query choices reflect business logic.”  
- INNER vs LEFT JOIN → what story do you want to tell?  
- Separate **numbers** from **descriptions** → Fact/Dimension modeling = flexibility  

---

## 4) Decisions & Assumptions  
- Used `LIMIT` in queries to avoid overloading my machine  
- Trade-off → safer but risk missing hidden outliers  

---

## 5) Open Questions  
- What are the real-world downsides of **over-normalization** (too many small tables)?  
- How are **dbt tests** integrated with **CI/CD pipelines**?  
- How do companies set thresholds for “acceptable data quality”?  

---

## 6) Next Actions  
- [ ] Break a simple wide table into **1NF → 3NF** and observe changes  
- [ ] Run a **dbt test** with intentional invalid data

### Mini Reflection  
**Today I realized how much query design affects the meaning of results.**  
A **LEFT JOIN** isn’t just code, it’s a choice about who gets represented in the data.  

Normalization reminded me to think about **structure before answers**.  
I had already learned the basics of normalization in college (ERP Clinic portal project), but today gave me a deeper understanding of *why structure matters*.  

Next time: practice balancing **“clean design”** with **“practical speed.”**
